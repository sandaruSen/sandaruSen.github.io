I'm a a PhD student at the School of Computing, The Australian National University. I’m part of the Big Data program of the “Our Health In Our Hands (OHIOH)” ANU Grand Challenge initiative. 

I completed my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I have worked as a Software Engineer in the travel industry.

My research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Health Informatics, ML, DL, and Biomedical NLP.

My current research focuses on exploring NLP, ML, and DL for improved readability and understandability of complex text with a specific focus on medical and scientific domains. If you are interested in collaborations, to learn more about my research, or in sharing your research work please contact me.
