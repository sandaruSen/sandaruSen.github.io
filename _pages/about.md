I'm a a PhD student at the School of Computing, The Australian National University. I’m part of the Big Data program of the “Our Health In Our Hands (OHIOH)” ANU Grand Challenge initiative. 

I completed my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I have worked as a trainee software engineer and a software engineer in the travel industry, developing software solutions to create stable reservation platforms.

My research interests are in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Health Informatics, ML, DL, and Biomedical NLP.

My current research focuses on exploring NLP, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) for improved readability and understandability of complex text with a specific focus on medical and scientific domains. If you are interested in collaborations, to learn more about my research, or in sharing your research work please contact me. 

**My research at a glance...**

Natural language is often ambiguous with complex words, acronyms, and abbreviations. Simplifying language may be an easy task for native speakers and people with high litercay skills. However, this is not true for non-native speakers, second language learners, and people with limited reading skills. This has a direct impact on the day-today life of the people. To bridge the gap of knowledge and avoid misinterpretation of text, it is vital to develop new methods to improve the readability and understandability of complex text. 

The advances in NLP, ML, and DL have resulted in improved methods which can assist people to easily understand complex text. My research aims to explore these methods for text simplification, focusing specifically on medical and scientific text.
